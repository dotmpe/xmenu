XMenu is a desktop menu utility for the X11 window system.
XMenu receives a menu specification in stdin, shows a menu for the user
to select one of the options, and outputs the selected option to stdout.

Features:
• Reads something in and prints something out, the UNIX way.
• Menu hierarchies (submenus).
• Icons and separators.
• Optional alternate activation (click a menu entry with middle-button).
• Customization via X resources.
• Multi-monitor support (via Xinerama).
• File navigation via menus (see “-f”)
• Torn-off (detachable) menus (see “-w”).
• Fine window management hints (see “-p” and “-t”).
• Use as a standalone desktop start-menu (see “-x”).


§ USAGE

Each line read from standard input is made of tab-separated fields
describing a menu entry.  Lines can be indented to make submenus.

For example, the following input generates the menu in <./demo.png>:

“
	Applications
		IMG:./icons/web.png	Web Browser	firefox
		IMG:./icons/gimp.png	Image editor	gimp
	Terminal (xterm)	xterm
	Terminal (urxvt)	urxvt
	Terminal (st)		st

	Shutdown		poweroff
	Reboot			reboot
”

An example script can be found at <./examples/xmenu.sh>.

Read the manual for more information on using XMenu.

In order to generate a menu of applications based on .desktop entries,
as specified by XDG, checkout <https://github.com/xlucn/xdg-xmenu>.


§ INSTALLATION

To build, run “make”.
That generates the ./xmenu binary.

To install, run “make install”
That copies the ./xmenu and ./xmenu.1 files into /usr/local/.

Dependencies:
• C99 compiler, for building.
• POSIX make, for building.
• Mandoc, for the manual.
• POSIX C standard library and headers (libc).
• X11 libraries and headers (libX11, libXft, libXinerama, libXrender).
• Imlib2 libraries and headers (libImlib2).
• Fontconfig library and headers (libfontconfig).
