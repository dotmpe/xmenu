(that is, the
.Xr basename 3

.Ic "argv[0]" ) .
.It Fl p Ar position

Without this option,
.Nm

Position is a string of the form
.Cm "GEOMETRY[:MONITOR]" ,
where
.Cm GEOMETRY
is a geometry parsed by
.Xr XParseGeometry 3 .
.Cm MONITOR
is the number of the monitor the geometry is relative to (counting from 0);
it can instead be a string like
.Qq Cm current
or
.Qq Cm cursor ,
specifyingthe monitor where the cursor is on.
.It Fl w

.Pp
Each item read from standard input has the following format
(bracket groups optional elements):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[TABS] [IMAGE TABS] LABEL [TABS OUTPUT] NEWLINE
.Ed
or
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[TABS] [:] NEWLINE
.Ed
.Pp
The components are as follows:

items indented with a tab are placed in a submenu of the preceding item not indented.
An item without initial tabs is a top-level item.
.It
The image is a string of the form
.Qq Cm "IMG:/path/to/image.png" .
It specifies the path to an image file to be shown as icon at the left of the entry.

or
.Qq Pa ../ ,
the file is searched on the paths specified in the
.Ev ICONPATH
environment variable.
.It
The label is the string that will be shown as an item in the menu.
An item without label or with a single colon
.Pq Cm \&:
as label is considered a separator and is drawn as a thin line in the menu
separating the item above from the item below.
.It
The output is the string that will be output after selecting the item.
If an item does not have tabs after the label, its label is used as its output.
If the output is empty or is a colon
